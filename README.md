"SAT>IP Client App based on "VLCKit” 

This app is a fully functionnining SAT>IP Client application for tvOS and iOS. It demonstrates the use of VLCKit for tvOS (dubbed TVVLCKit) and iOS (dubbed MobileVLCKit) to discover SAT>IP servers, feed a custom channel list from a m3u file and finally play a channel of your choice. Additionally, it gives an introduction to video output view manipulation with VLCKit.

Requirements
This project uses the dynamic framework variants of VLCKit and therefore requires iOS 8 or tvOS 9. Note that bitcode is enabled only for the tvOS package. 
Everything was tested with Xcode 7 on OS X 10.11 only.

•	Download the respective framework binary images, unpack and safely store them somewhere on your Mac. 
•	Open the xcode workspace 
•	Navigate to either target and fix your Framework Search Paths to have them point to the correct folder on your Mac.
